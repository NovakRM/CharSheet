# CharSheet
Eventual user-generated (via JS/dynamic styling) simple DND 5E Character Sheet

- Some inline styling has been done, working on adding that to CSS 

# ISSUES: 
- Elements in left sidebar shuffle poorly on mobile and small viewports, don't look great on higher width screens either
    - Stats progress bars shuffle over icon when viewport is decreased

    - Inventory item columns break from two-up, three across

    See:
    ./Ref/Incorrect_View.png

    - Mobile view's...bad.
        - Would like to align sidebar elements left or center when in mobile view? At least some method to keep them consistent

        - Horizontal headers in right-hand body element shuffle to stack on top of each other, don't want that to happen

        - Skill columns probably just need some vertical padding or a horizontal rule to keep them distinct, that one's doable

    ./Ref/Mobile_View.png & ./Ref/Mobile_View2.png

- See ./Ref/Preferred_Viewport.png for where I want to keep this template locked at for all viewports
